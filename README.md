# PluginList-Reloaded

# This is a project designed for use in Spigot 1.11

# Offers enhancements to the current pluginlist, including:
# - Filtering out plugins by letter name
# - Displaying plugin state as enabled or disabled through chat colour
# - Separating plugins in order to make them easier to see
# - Providing extra utilities such as plugin count and count by letter
