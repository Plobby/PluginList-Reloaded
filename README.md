# About
A server-side Minecraft plugin that makes optimisations and improvements to the default Spigot plugin list (/pl). Currently built for Spigot 1.11.

Improvements over the default Spigot system include:
- Filtering out plugins by letter name
- Displaying plugin state through chat colour
- Separating plugins in order to make them easier to see
- Providing extra utilities such as plugin count
